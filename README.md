## About
I am a Full Stack Developer with a strong background in Test Management. I have just completed an intensive bootcamp with EDA that teaches both technical and personal skills with experience in group project.  Horoeka 2020 was a cohort of 17 students with a diverse range of people. 

I have experience in React, Redux, SQLite3, Postgres, CSS & HTML. I have a proven ability to quickly adapt to new environments, absorb and relate information efficiently, as well as manage senior stakeholders through the project life cycle. I believe that the successful delivery of a good business solution resides primarily with understanding the business problem and using that knowledge to deliver high quality products. 

## History
I graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science in 2003.  In 2020 I made a career decision and reconnected with my development roots and have now graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy as a full-stack developer.
